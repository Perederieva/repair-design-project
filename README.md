## Instruction, how to install and start project.

    I used watcher in IDE `PhpStorm` to compile SCSS into CSS
    
    1. In PhpStorm write command in the terminal  ` npm install -g sass `
    2. In the top bar go to: File -> Settings -> choose Tools -> File Watcher.
    3. Click `+` to add New File Watcher.
    4. In the window that appears, write or select path in the line `Program`: 
            `C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\npm\sass.cmd`
